I used PyCharm to code so run it through there.
At the bottom of main.py there are five variables to fill in:
plainText
cipherText
key
Nk
Nr
Fill out the variables accordingly and then just uncomment the cipher or
invCipher functions below those variables. It should print out the correct
outputs.

I only used the resources listed.

I passed all the test cases in Appendix C.
